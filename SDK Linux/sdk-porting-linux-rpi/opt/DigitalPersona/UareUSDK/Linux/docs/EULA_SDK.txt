termination or expiration of the Evaluation Period. DigitalPersona may 
terminate Your right to use the evaluation or beta version of the 
Software Product at any time by providing a written notice to You. Your 
rights to use the evaluation or beta version of the Software Product 
will cease upon the earlier of notification by DigitalPersona of

supplemental Software Product code provided to You as a part of Support 
Services shall be deemed part of the Software Product and subject to the 
terms of this EULA. With respect to any technical information You 
provide while using Support Services, DigitalPersona may use such 
information for its business purposes, including without limitation, 
general product support and development. DigitalPersona will not use 
such technical information in a form or manner that personally 
identifies You. 

7. Limited Warranty; Disclaimer of Warranties. If DigitalPersona 
provided the Software Product to You on tangible media, DigitalPersona 
represents that such media in the form originally received by You and 
under normal use, will be free from defects in material and workmanship, 
for a period of ninety (90) days from the ship date of original Software 
Product You acquired as shown on Your receipt or similar proof of 
payment (the "Warranty Period"). EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTIES 
ABOVE, DIGITALPERSONA AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS OR RESELLERS MAKE NO OTHER 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY

LAW, THE DURATION OF SAID IMPLIED WARRANTIES IS LIMITED TO NINETY (90) 
DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. 

If an upgrade or update to the Software Product is delivered with a new 
warranty period, then the terms of such new warranty period will apply 
only to the upgraded Software Product, and not the original Software 
Product. Any replacement Software Product will be warranted for the 
remainder of the original Software Warranty Period or thirty (30) days, 
whichever is longer. 

DigitalPersona's sole obligation and Your exclusive remedy under the 
limited warranties above shall be, at DigitalPersona's option, either a 
refund of the price paid (if any), or replacement of the Software 
Product that does not meet the DigitalPersona limited warranties, and 
that is returned to DigitalPersona with a copy of Your receipt or other 
such acceptable proof of purchase.

that You may not enter into a settlement providing for any restriction 
on DigitalPersona or the DigitalPersona technology without 
DigitalPersona's prior written consent, and provided further that 
DigitalPersona shall have the right to be represented by its own

will notify DigitalPersona in writing if any of its owners, partners, 
principals, and officers are or become during the term of this Agreement 
officials, officers or representatives of any government or political 
party or candidate for political office outside the United States and 
are responsible for a decision regarding obtaining or retaining business 
for products by such government. 

13.4 Government Rights. You acknowledge and agree that the Software 
Product and all related materials thereto licensed under this EULA are 
"Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software 
Documentation" as defined in FAR 12.212 for civilian agencies and DFARS 
227.7202 for military agencies and their successors, and in the event 
You are permitted under this EULA to provide the Software Product, or a 
portion thereof, to the U.S. Government, such Software Product shall be 
provided under the terms of this EULA, or terms at least as restrictive 
as the terms of this EULA. If You are permitted under this EULA to 
provide the Software Product, or a portion thereof, to a non-U.S. 
government entity, You shall take all necessary steps to ensure that 
DigitalPersona's intellectual property and proprietary rights in and to 
the Software Product receive the maximum protection available from such 
non-U.S. government for commercial computer software and documentation. 

13.5 Severability. If any provision of this EULA is declared 
unenforceable, illegal or invalid by a competent tribunal under 
applicable law, then such provision shall be deemed automatically 
adjusted to conform to the requirements for validity and enforceability, 
and so adjusted, shall be deemed a provision of this EULA as though 
originally included herein. In the event that the abovementioned 
provision is of such a nature that it cannot be so adjusted, such 
provision shall be deleted from the EULA, and the remaining provisions 
of the EULA shall remain in full force and effect. WITHOUT LIMITING THE 
FOREGOING, IT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT EACH AND EVERY 
PROVISION OF THIS EULA WHICH PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, 
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED BY THE 
PARTIES TO BE SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY OTHER SUCH PROVISION. 
FURTHER, IN THE EVENT THAT ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE 
FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND 
EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT. 

13.6 No Agency. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as creating 
any agency, partnership, franchise or other form of joint enterprise 
between the parties. 

13.7 No Waiver. The failure of either party to require performance by 
the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right 
to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver 
by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to 
be a waiver of the provision itself. 

13.8 Notices. All notices or demands hereunder shall be sent to the 
attention of the other party's Legal Department and will be deemed 
delivered upon acknowledgment of receipt by the other party. 

13.9 Language. This EULA is prepared and entered into in the English 
language only, which language shall be controlling in all respects. Any 
translations of this EULA into any other language are for reference only 
and shall have no legal or other effect. 

13.10 Entire Agreement. This EULA contains and constitutes the sole, 
complete and entire agreement and understanding between You and 
DigitalPersona concerning the matters contained herein and may not be 
altered, modified or changed in any manner except with DigitalPersona's 
prior written consent. No statements, promises or representations have 
been made by one party to the other, and the parties are not relying on 
any representations other than those expressly set forth herein.
